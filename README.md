## 3D Face Reconstruction Using Deep Learning Techniques & Real-Time Visualization (RT3D-FaceRecon)

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a deep learning model to reconstruct 3D faces from 2D images, with real-time feedback to enhance dynamic visualization. The model processes each frame in a video stream, creating accurate 3D face representations optimized for applications like videoconferencing and interactive visualization.

## Key Objectives
- Real-time 3D face reconstruction from 2D images.
- Efficient transmission of facial data for low-latency applications.
- Real-time visualization capabilities using WebGL Studio.

## Methodology
The project employs a PCA-based 3D model to represent facial configurations efficiently. The AFLW2000-3D dataset and 3DDFA library were used to create 3D point clouds, with a neural network trained using ResNet for dimensionality reduction. The modelâ€™s outputs are used to reconstruct the 3D face in real time.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, CNNs
- **Visualization Platform:** WebGL Studio
- **Techniques Used:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA), ResNet architecture for feature extraction, 3D point cloud generation

## Disclaimers
- The AFLW2000-3D dataset, 3DDFA, PCA implementations, and trained models are not included.
